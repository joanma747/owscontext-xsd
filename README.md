owscontext-xsd
==============

http://schemas.opengis.net/owc/1.0 contains the official RelaxNG compact schemas to validate OWS  
Context files. 

You might be used to other validation alternatives. This repository is willing to help you in  
finding other validation possibilities that are not official but equally useful.

Alternative 1:
Use the RelaxNG XML format: owc.rng

Alternative 2:
Use a combination of XSD schemas owc.xsd and Schematron ows.sch
